Running the Applications requires .NET8 (And maybe admin access if you run on lower ports [433, etc])

To Connect to application you need MODIFY your LIVE or an "LTS" version of you tarkov!
MY MOD for it is currently CLOSED SOURCE. Alternative is "Tarkov.Base" (Not updated)
Mod will be on an addon/"plugin" for the already existing "Tarkov.Base" 
You can use any "Core" patches and will work. (AKI/SIT/..etc)
