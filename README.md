# Tarkov Server
Tarkov Server on C#

This is my attempt to port existing JavaScript(nodejs) code to C#.\
Because I am not want and familiar with JS and his funny stuffs.

And possibly easier to make a nice Server UI with this (Xaml, or just Winform).\
Still in early phase, in development!

## Mod/Plugin support
You can add your or anyone plugin, but be careful cus they can use any malicius code.\
Dont obfuscate plugin because it will not work! Need to get the Plugin.Plugin to load. More on Mod/Plugin Wiki! (In future)\
You can check TestPlugin for some of the changes.

You can add you own idea or anything, make a PR and I will check it. Feel free to import something you like.

## Releases
Because I used 2 project to make server work (Lib + Console), Probably its gonna be hard to make a proper "Build/Release" for it, I still looking for a solution
